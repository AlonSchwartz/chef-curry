### Chef Curry is a web application that allows you to create delicious curry-based dishes using the power of AI.

### It's a personal project which I started in order to get deeper knowledge and practical experience with Web development and getting more familar with AI engines/API. I added two of my hobbies - Basketball and Cooking, and I ended up with a project that is much larger than my first intent, gaining more experience than I thought, and having fun during the entire journey.

###  Built with Angular 16 and Angular Material.
